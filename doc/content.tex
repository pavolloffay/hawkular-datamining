\chapter{Introduction}
In driving successful business on the internet it is important to assure an application
health and reliability. One can achieve that by monitoring subjected resources and setting
up a clever alerting system. These features are offered in many monitoring systems, however 
being predictive in this area can even prevent undesirable states and most importantly gives administrators more time for
reacting to such events. For instance it can decrease downtime of an application 
or ability to load balance workload in advance by horizontal scaling targeted services. 

As alerting system are sophisticated and can be composed by many conditions so this work
focuses only on predicting future metrics values which are then sent as input to an alerting system. 

In the first chapter are discussed various approaches for time series modeling and
forecasting. Second chapter focuses on implemented models with validation on real and 
generated test data sets. Implementation details with testing can be found in fourth chapter.

    \section{Hawkular}
    The implementation part of the master's thesis is developed as a part of an open source project
    Hawkular\footnote{Available at \url{http://www.hawkular.org}}. 
    Therefore the application architecture and used technologies had to fit 
    into the overall project architecture.

    Hawkular is middleware monitoring and management platform
    developed by company Red Hat and independent community of contributors.
    It is a successor to very successful RHQ\footnote{Available at \url{https://rhq-project.github.io/rhq/}.}
    project, also known as JBoss Operations Network (JON).
    By monitoring is meant that there are agents for diverse applications which
    push data to the server. These agents can also execute application specific actions. 

    The monolithic architecture of RHQ project was due it's size hard to maintain 
    and lacking robust REST API lead to fresh development of new application.   
    In contrast Hawkular consist of several loosely coupled or even independent applications.
    These independent components are much
    easier to maintain and more importantly they communicate over REST API. This
    architecture of microservices and chosen protocol allow simple development of 
    agents which can be written in any programming language. In RHQ only Java agent were
    available. Hawkular as product is customized Wildfly
    \footnote{An open source project of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.}
    application server with all components deployed in it.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Console\,--\,user web interface
        \item Accounts\,--\,authorization subsystem based on Keycloak\footnote{An open
            source single sing-on and identity management for RESTful web services.}
        \item Inventory\,--\,graph based registry of all entities in Hawkular
        \item Metrics\,--\,time series metrics engine based on Cassandra\footnote{An open
            source distributed database management system. Hybrid between key-value and
        column\,--\,oriented database.}
        \item Alerts\,--\,alerting subsystem based on JBoss Drools
    \end{itemize}

    Some of the modules uses also Java messaging topics (JMS) for inter-component
    one to many communication.

    Modules are packaged as standard Java web archives (WAR), or enterprise archives (EAR)
    and deployed into customized Wildfly. Build and package management is performed by 
    Maven and Gulp for user interface modules. 

    \section{Data Mining Goals}
    The goal of this thesis is to develop module for Hawkular which will provide forecasts for any 
    time series metrics collected by agent. On new metric data available the module
    learns from data and predicts new values. Based on this predicted values an alert can
    be triggered. Forecast should be also available for user interface in predictive
    charts. 

    One Wildfly agent on average collects hundreds to thousands metrics, therefore module
    should be capable of processing high volume of data. Some of the customers monitor
    hundreds of server each with multiple agents. Therefore performance of chosen 
    learning algorithm has to be taken in account.

\chapter{Time Series Models} \label{models}
This chapter focuses on time series theory and various approaches for modelling time series.
Models are ordered from simpler to more complex ones. 

Firstly, it is important to define time series; it is sequence of observations
$s_t \in \mathbb{R}$ ordered in time. This thesis focuses only on univariate equidistant 
discrete time series. Time series analysis contains many segments, this work focuses on 
forecasting. It is defined as a process of making prediction of the future based 
on the past. In other words, forecasting is possible because  
future depends on the past or analogously because there is a relationship
between the future and the past. However, this relation is not deterministic and 
can be hardly written in an analytical form.

There are two forecasting types: qualitative and quantitative.
Qualitative methods are mainly based on the opinion of the subject and are used 
when past data are not available, hence not suitable for this project. 
If there are past data available, quantitative forecasting methods are more suitable. 

TODO mention that we talk only about models which makes sense to use in our environment.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Simple quantitative methods}
    Following methods are the simples forecasting quantitative models. They can be used on
    any time series without further analysis. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Average method\,--\,forecasts are equal to the value of the mean of
            historical data.
            \begin{eqnarray}
                \hat{y}_{T+h|T} = \overline{y} = (y_{1}+ \dots + y_{T}) / T 
            \end{eqnarray}
        \item Na\"{i}ve method\,--\,forecasts are equal to the last observed value.
            \begin{eqnarray}
                \hat{y}_{T+h|T} = y_{T}
            \end{eqnarray}
        \item Drift method\,--\,variation of na\"{i}ve method which allow the
            forecasts to increase or decrease over time.
            \begin{eqnarray}
                \hat{y}_{T+h|T} = y_{T} + \frac{h}{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^T{y_{t} - y_{t-1}} = 
                    y_{T} + h(\frac{y_{T}-y_{1}}{T-1}) 
            \end{eqnarray}

    \end{itemize}
    There is also a seasonal variant of na\"{i}ve model. This method is suitable only
    for highly seasonal data. These methods in general produces high forecasting error 
    but are very easy to implement.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Linear Regression} \label{sec:linear-regression}
    Linear regression is classical statistical analysis technique. It is often used to
    determine whether there is linear relationship between dependent and eventually more
    independent variables. It is also often used for predictions mainly in econometric
    field. 

    Simple linear regression is defined as:
    \begin{eqnarray}
        y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
    \end{eqnarray}

    Parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are calculated by minimizing the sum of squared
    errors:
    
    \begin{eqnarray}
        SSE = \sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon_{i}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2
    \end{eqnarray}
    
    Once parameters are estimated predictions for any time in the future can be calculated. 
    If modelled time series is not stationary then and for instance trend changes over
    time parameters has to be periodically estimated to achieve better accuracy. 
    %For econometric analysis it is important to use best linear unbiased estimator,
    %where couple of assumptions has to hold:
    %\begin{enumerate}
    %    \item $E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$
    %    \item $var(Y_i)=\sigma^2$\,--\,homoscedasticity
    %    \item $cov(Y_i, Y_j)=0$, for $i \neq j$
    %    \item $Y_i$ cames from normal distribution
    %    \item $X_i$ is not random variable
    %\end{enumerate}
    %Where $i$ takes values from $1$ to the number of observed values. These assumptions 

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Simple Exponential Smoothing}
    The concept behind simple exponential smoothing is to attach 
    larger weights to the most recent observations than to observations from distant
    past. Forecasts are calculated using weighted averages where the weights 
    decrease exponentially as observations come from further in the past.
    In other words smaller weights are associated to older observations.
    Equation for simple exponential smoothing is listed in \ref{exp_smoothing}.

    \begin{gather} \label{exp_smoothing}
         \hat{y}_{T+1|T} = l_t \\ \nonumber
         l_t = \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha)l_{t-1}
    \end{gather}

    For smoothing parameter $\alpha$ holds $ 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 $. Note, if $\alpha = 1$ then \\
    $\hat{y}_{T+1|T} = y_{T}$ so forecasts are equal to the na\"{i}ve method.
    If the parameter $\alpha $ is smaller more weight is given to observations from distance
    in past. 

    Simple exponential smoothing has flat forecast function, that means all forecasts
    all the same. Smoothing can be generally used as technique to separate signal and noise.
    This method is useful if a series does not contain any trend or one is interested only
    in one step ahead prediction. Multi step ahead predictions for time series with trend
    can produce high error.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Holt's Liner Trend Method}
    Simple exponential smoothing can be extended to allow forecasting of data with a trend. 
    This was done by Charles C. Holt in 1957. This method is slightly more complicated than 
    original one without trend. In order to add trend component another equation has to be added. 

    \begin{gather} \label{exp_holt}
        \hat{y}_{t+h|t} = l_{t} + hb_{t} \\ \nonumber
         l_t = \alpha y_t + (1 - \alpha) (l_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\ \nonumber
         b_t = \beta (l_t - l_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta)b_{t-1} 
    \end{gather}

    Where a parameter $b_t$ denotes a slope of the series and the parameter $l_t$ level. 
    There is also a new parameter smoothing parameter of the slope\,--\,$\beta$. 
    It's rage is equal to $\alpha$, so $\alpha,\beta \in \interval[{0,1}]$. 

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Holt-Winters Seasonal Method}
    This method is an extension of Holt's linear trend method with added
    seasonality. It is also called triple exponential smoothing. In this model 
    there are three equations \ref{exp_holt_winters}. 
    One for level, second for trend and third for seasonality.
    Each pattern uses smoothing constant $ \alpha,\beta,\gamma \in \interval[{0,1}]$.

    \begin{gather} \label{exp_holt_winters}
        \hat{y}_{t+h|t} = l_{t} + hb_{t} + s_{t+h_m-m}\\ \nonumber
        l_t = \alpha (y_t - s_{t-m}) + (1 - \alpha) (l_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\ \nonumber
        b_t = \beta (l_t - l_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta)b_{t-1} \\ \nonumber
        s_t = \gamma (y_t - l_{t-1} - b_{t-1}) + (1-\gamma)s_{t-m}
    \end{gather}

    Where $h_m=[(h-1) \mod m] + 1$, which ensures that the estimates of the seasonal
    indices came from the correct season. This model can be used only if the period 
    of time series is know beforehand. In Hawkular the period of the time series is 
    unknown, therefore period identification should be also implemented.
    
    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Box\,--\,Jenkins Methodology (ARIMA)}
    Models from Box\,--\,Jenkins methodology are the most widely used in time series
    analysis specially for econometric data. This methodology is based on analysis of autocorrelation (ACF)
    and partial autocorrelation (PACF) functions.
    
    The most generic model is ARIMA(p, d, q). It combines together autoregressive, integrated and
    moving average models. An autoregressive model (AR) consist of sum of weighed lagged observations. It is listed
    in \ref{ar_model}. The order of this model is defined by $p$ and can be determined from PACF function \cite{cipra}.
    A moving average model (MA) is sum of weighted errors of order $q$. The order of this part can be
    determined from ACF function \cite{cipra}. The last part of the model is used when a time series is non stationary.
    There are several ways how to make a  particular time series stationary. Box\,--\,Jenkins methodology uses
    differencing\,--\,integration part. The order if differencing original series is denoted by $d$ letter. Usually
    first order differences are enough to make time series stationary.

    Parameters of the model, including AR and MA part can by estimated by non-linear
    least squares or maximum likelihood estimation \cite{brockwell}. For successful estimation a certain number of
    historical points needs to be available. In \cite{cipra} minimal training size is set to at least fifty
    observations.

    \begin{gather} \label{ar_model}
        y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t \\ \nonumber
        \epsilon_t \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)
    \end{gather}

    Moving averages model should not be confused with simple moving average which is
    used for trend estimation. In moving average model MA(q) the current value is
    a regression against white noise of prior values of the series \cite{wiki-ma-model}. A random noise from
    each point is assumed to come from the same distribution which typically is 
    a normal distribution. Model of the order $q$ is listed in \ref{ma_model}.

    \begin{gather} \label{ma_model}
        y_t = \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_p y_{t-q} + \epsilon_t \\ \nonumber
        \epsilon_t \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)
    \end{gather}

    It is important mention that models AR(p) and MA(q) are invertible.
    Therefore any stationary AR(p) model can be written as MA($\infty$) and with some assumptions
    vice versa \cite{brockwell}. ARIMA model is often written with backshift operator $By_t=y_{t-1}$.
    With this operator \\ARIMA(p, d, q) is listed in \ref{arima}. On the left side of the equation is AR(P) process
    and on the right MA(q).

    \begin{gather} \label{arima}
        (1- \phi_1B - \dots - \phi_pB^p)(1-B)^d y_t = \\ \nonumber
         c + (1+\theta_1B+\dots+\theta_qB^q) \epsilon_t
    \end{gather}

    After this theoretical part it is clear that ARIMA models are more complicated than family of moving averages.
\newpage
    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Artificial Neural Networks}
    Recently a large number of successful applications using neural networks for time series modeling show that they
    can produce valuable results \cite{ann-forecasting-state-art}. There are several non trivial issues with
    determining the appropriate architecture of the network. This has to be taken into account because it can
    dramatically effect learning performance and forecasting accuracy \cite{ann-model-selecting}.
    Besides the problems with selecting right architecture learning process of artificial neural network is much more
    computationally expensive than selecting appropriate ARIMA or exponential smoothing model \cite{ann-forecasting}.

    Because Hawkular forecasting engine should be capable of predicting thousands of metrics at the same time, models
    based on neural networks would have too high computational requirements. Therefore they are not suitable for our
    environment.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Time series decomposition}
    In modelling time series it is sometimes necessary to decompose series to trend, seasonal and random component
    \cite{otexts}. It is also used for initialization seasonal indices in triple exponential smoothing.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trend $ T_{t} $}\,--\,exists if there is long term increase or decrease over
            time. Can be linear or nonlinear (e.g. exponential growth)
        \item \textbf{Seasonal $ S_{t} $}\,--\,exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors.
            Seasonality is always of fixed and known period.
        \item \textbf{Cyclic $ C_{t} $}\,--\,exists it there are long term wave-like patterns.
            Waves are not of a fixed period.
        \item \textbf{Irregular $ E_{t} $}\,--\,unpredictable random value referred as white
            noise. 
    \end{itemize}

    Decomposition can be written in many forms. Two of them are additive and multiplicative \ref{decomposition}.
    Which one to use depends on the underlying time series model.

    \begin{eqnarray} \label{decomposition}
        y_{t} = T_{t} + S_{t} + C_{t} + E_{t} \\
        y_{t} = T_{t} \times S_{t} \times C_{t} \times E_{t}
    \end{eqnarray}

    An algorithm for additive decomposition consist of following steps:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compute a trend component $\hat{T}_t$ using moving average model. If a period is even use
        $2 x MA(period)$. If period is an odd number use $MA(period)$. $2 x MA$ for even period is used because it
        has to be symmetric.
        \item Calculate detrended series $y_t - \hat{T}_t$.
        \item Estimate seasonal indices $\hat{S}_t$ for each period by averaging values of given period. For example,
         the seasonal index for Monday is the average for all detrended Monday values in the data. Then the mean of
         seasonal indices is subtracted from each period.
        \item Random component is calculated by subtracting trend and seasonal component from original time series
            $\hat{E}_t = y_t - \hat{T}_t - \hat{S}_t$.
    \end{itemize}

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Augmented Dickey\,--\,Fuller Test}
    Time series statistical tests are often used for testing if there is particular characteristics present in time
    series. Unit root test are used whether a time series in non stationary. In this work Augmented \\Dickey\,--\,Fuller
    (ADF) test was chosen for unit root testing. It's null hypothesis $H_0$ is time series contains a
    unit root\,--\,it is not stationary. Outcome of this test is a negative ADF statistics. The more negative it is
    the stronger the rejection of the hypothesis. The full form of ADF test is listen in \ref{adf-test}.

    \begin{gather} \label{adf-test}
        \Delta y_t = \alpha + \beta t + \gamma \Delta y_{t-1} + \dots + \delta{p-1} \Delta y_{t-p+1} + \epsilon_t \\
        ADF = \frac{\hat{\gamma}}{SE(\hat{\gamma})} \label{adf-stat}
    \end{gather}

\newpage

    There are multiple variants of ADF test. Some of them leave out some parts of equation \ref{adf-test}.
    The most important ones and widely used are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{nc}\,--\,for regression with no constant nor time trend ($\beta t$)
        \item \emph{c}\,--\,for regression with an intercept but no time trend ($\beta t$)
        \item \emph{ct}\,--\,for regression with an intercept and time trend
    \end{itemize}

    Each of them is good for testing particular type of stationarity. For example for testing if there is time trend
    present in the time series \emph{c} version is best choice.

    The implementation of this test is to fit multiple linear regression model of equation \ref{adf-test}. Then
    calculate ADF statistics with \ref{adf-stat}. SE denotes standard error of estimated $\hat{\gamma}$.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Seasonality detection}
    Forecasting engine in Hawkular system does not have any inside information of period of a time series being
    modelled. Therefore automatic period identification has to be implemented. In practice it is a difficult task and
    result often differs from correct period, specially if there is significant noise present in the series
    \cite{period-meteo}.

    There are several ways how to implement automatic period identification. The most used ones are based on
    autocorrelation function (ACF) or spectral density \cite{period-hydman}. This work applies ACF method.
    In the following chart \ref{img:period-acf} ACF function of sine function is shown. The period of this
    function is seven. There are patterns repeated every seven observations and it is decreasing to zero.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \scalebox{0.73}[0.6]{\includegraphics{img/acf-sine.pdf}}
            \caption{ACF of sine function.}
            \label{img:period-acf}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    The algorithm for automatic period identification is demonstrated in \ref{alg:period-find}. It uses ACF function
    It is looking for periodically significant values of ACF function. These values have to be decreasing to zero at
    some rate. At the infinity lag ACF approach zero.

    The algorithm first calculates autocorrelation function of input time series and it finds index of the highest
    value. Follows checking it checks if there are significant values of ACF present at following $n*period$
    indices of autocorrelation function. There have to be present at lease two consecutive values of ACF, so $n$ takes
    values from $1,2,3\dots$

    \begin{algorithm}
        \caption{Find period of time series} \label{alg:period-find}

                    \State \Return $period$
                \EndIf

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Models Demonstration}
In the previous chapter several models for forecasting were discussed, however in Hawkular only a few of them were
selected and implemented. It is because various time complexity of the models and more important robustness in terms of
being able to produce accurate results for higher range of modelled time series.
Following model evaluations and graphs are generated using statistical system R.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Metrics in Hawkular}
    In Hawkular there are three types of metrics: gauge, counter and availability. All of them are univariate metrics
    of structure \\$\{timestamp, value\}$. Each of these types is used for collecting dedicated types of metric data.
    For example gauge can increase or decrease over the time, counter is monotonically decreasing or increasing and
    availability represents up or down state of a resource.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Evaluating Forecasting Accuracy}
    In order to evaluate model it is important to estimate an error of the forecast. There are 
    several statistics for evaluating forecasting errors. The most used ones are mean squared error (MSE)
    \ref{accuracy-mse} and mean absolute error (MAE) \ref{accuracy-mae}. The difference between them is that MSE
    emphasizes the extremes while MAE is more robust to outliers.

    \begin{subequations} \label{accuracy}
        \begin{align} \label{accuracy-mse}
             MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i}) \\ \label{accuracy-mae}
             MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \abs{y_i - \hat{y_i}}
         \end{align}
    \end{subequations}

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Model Selection} \label{model-selection}
    When comparing multiple models, statistics like MSE or MAE are not the best objective functions. Comparison
    based on this statistics can select complicated model with lots of parameters, which may overfits training data
    and most importantly it selects less robust model \cite{cipra}. Therefore for comparing multiple models another
    factors has to be added to the objective function. These factors are number of parameters of the model. The
    most used criteria for model sections are: Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information
    criterion (BIC). Model with lower information criterion is preferred.

    \begin{gather} \label{aic}
        AIC = 2 k - \ln(L) \\ \nonumber
        BIC = k \ln(n) - 2 \ln(L)
    \end{gather}

    Equations for AIC and BIC are listed in \ref{aic}. Number of parameters of the model represents $k$, $n$ is number
    of observations and $L$ is maximized value of the likelihood function of the model. In case for exponential
    smoothing it is minimized sum of squared error of one step ahead prediction of training data set. From the
    equations it can be seen that BIC penalizes models with more parameters. There is also AIC criterion with
    correction form \ref{aicc}. Corrected version of AIC more penalizes longer models.

    \begin{eqnarray} \label{aicc}
        AICc = AIC + \frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1}
    \end{eqnarray}

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Evaluation on Data}
    An analytical process of modelling time series advise to plot the data and fit various models chosen by an
    forecaster previous experience. In second step compare statistics of those models and choose one the best describes
    data. However, this approach can be used only if a process of modelling is conducted by human being.

    In this section a real time series is modelled using time series discussed in section \ref{models}.
    Chosen time series is \emph{austourists} from R package \texttt{fpp}. This series is a measurement of quarterly
    visitor nights spent by international tourists in Australia. It was chosen on purpose because it
    contains trend and seasonality.

    In the first chart \ref{img:simple-models} there is depicted na\"{i}ve, average and drift model. Average model is
    just an overall average of the whole time series. It does not change over time. However there could be online
    version of this algorithm for which an average would be calculated for each new value. Na\"{i}ve and drift model
    copy values of time series with one step lag. These two models differs in forecasts. Drift model is capable of
    capturing trends.

    Exponential smoothings are depicted in \ref{img:exp-smoothings}. For this particular series it is obvious that
    seasonal is the best describing modelled time series. In the beginning can be seen how it the seasonal model
    changing and learning the seasonal pattern from data. Learning and adaptivity to new trends depends on smoothing
    parameters of the models. Higher values of parameters allows the model to quicker adapt to changes. Models with
    lower smoothing parameters are more robust to the changes.

    Arima models are showed in \ref{img:arimas}. Non seasonal model is already capable of capturing some seasonal
    patterns but it is more random whereas seasonal patterns should be of fixed period. Therefore seasonal Arima with
    dedicated model for each period is more appropriate.

    is seasonal Arima and triple exponential smoothing which is correct for highly seasonal time series such as this
    one. For model selection would be used AIC statistics which is correlated to MSE.

\chapter{Existing Solutions}
Before directly going to the design and implementation let's briefly look at existing monitoring solutions and libraries
for time series modelling. In the next section are described not only direct competitors of Hawkular but also
generally available software of this kind. Because Hawkular is still only an upstream project and not deliverable
product for the customers thereby as alternative is considered Jboss Operations Network (JON). This work does not
focus on comparison of monitoring applications. It is mentioned for more wider overview of this domain and also
if some libraries can be used in the implementation.

    \section{Monitoring and Management Platforms}
    Out there are many monitoring solutions available. Some of them are offered as service (SaaS) and other need to be
    deployed in customer's environment. For each application are highlighted the most important features and how it
    differs from its rivals. It is also mentioned if the application offers predictive engine for metric data.

    \subsection{New Relic}
    New Relic was the first monitoring solution offered as SaaS \cite{new-relic}. It focuses on application performance
    rather than infrastructure view. Java applications monitoring is done by agent. Because agent manipulates
    with bytecote it is able to identify business transactions and monitor for instance utilization of REST endpoints
    Agent also automatically identifies databases connected to the application being monitored. From alert
    prediction perspective New Relic does not offer alert prediction or predictive charts.

    \subsection{Dynatrace Ruxit}
    Ruxit is another popular SaaS solution for monitoring middleware applications. Monitoring is also done by agents
    which instruments bytecode so the application is also able to monitor business transactions. Ruxit differs from
    others that it offers root cause analysis rather than firing multiple alerts. It directly shows causing problems
    with visual representation \cite{ruxit}. Ruxit does not offer predictive alerting or charts.

    \subsection{Open Source Projects}
    As Hawkular is an open source project it is important to mention it's direct competitors from this area. There are
    two major open source projects. The first one is Nagios and second Zabbix. Nagios was started in 1991 and Zabbix
    in 2001 therefore both are more than fifteen years old. By the time of writing this thesis last contribution to
    Nagios was from 17th September 2015 and Nagios project was active until the last moment. Both these projects does
    not offer alert prediction.

    \subsection{HP OpenView and IBM Tivoli}
    The biggest monitoring solutions offered by these two software giants are HP OpenView and IBM Tivoli. Both are
    composed of many independent products. Solution from HP does not offer any predictive capabilities.

    Operations Analytics, one of IBM Tivoli products can automatically detect correlations between
    metrics which can lead to detection of application issues, for example an anomaly detection. Another part of Tivoli
    solution\,--\,Netcool Network Management is capable of predicting events. There is also another predictive analysis
    in Tivoli Monitoring module\footnote{Available at
    \url{https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en\#/wiki/Tivoli+Monitoring/page/Details+for+ITPA+Predictive+Analytics+and+Non+Linear+Trending}.}
    In the online document there is mentioned that predictive engine does not work on real time streams of data. Tivoli
    is definitely big solution and in order to get real predictive capabilities it would require to contact IBM
    support.

    \section{Libraries For Time Series Forecasting} \label{libraries-for-ts}
    In Java there is only one publicly available library for time series modelling. The library is called
    OpenForecast\footnote{Available at \url{http://www.stevengould.org/software/openforecast/index.shtml}.}. It contains
    models like na\"{i}ve, linear regression and exponential smoothings. Whereas the library is open source, code
    was reviewed and tested. Some assumptions about the implementation were made. The parameters of some models are
    not estimated correctly. For example in linear regression slope and intercept are not estimated by minimizing
    sum of squared error.

    The library provides nice feature called automatic forecaster which selects the best model for given
    time series, however the code produces null pointer exception. The bug was identified but the library is no any more
    maintained.

    Performance of the library was also tested. Table \ref{tab:open-forecast-perf} contains execution times of
    simple, double and triple exponential smoothing models. The tested time series is generated sine function of
    length 200 observations. The result is compared against execution times of R's function \texttt{ets} from
    \texttt{forecast} package.

    \begin{table}[h]
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
                \textbf{Model} & \textbf{OpenForecast} & \textbf{R \texttt{forecast}} \\ \hline \hline
                Simple ex. & 4.91 sec. & 0.003 sec.\\
                Double ex. & 9.31 sec. & 0.006 sec.\\
                Triple ex. & 6.45 sec. & 0.209 sec.\\
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Execution time of parameters estimation for exponential smoothing models.}
            \label{tab:open-forecast-perf}
        \end{center}
    \end{table}

    From the table it is obvious that R's implementation is much faster. For example optimization of thousand double
    exponential smoothing models would take about two and half hour. This results are not acceptable for Hawkular in
    real time environment.

    Another possibility is to directly use R implementation. There are various libraries\footnote{The most widely used:
    RCaller and JRI}
    which allow executing R code from Java, however it requires installed R system in the target environment. Other
    possible solution is to use Rengin\footnote{Available at \url{http://www.renjin.org/}}\,--\,JVM interpreter for R.
    However \texttt{forecast} package depends on other package which allow native C++ invocation for optimized
    computations. Therefore package \texttt{forecast} can not be used with Rengin.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Design and Implementation} \label{design-impl}
The module for an alert prediction is named Hawkular Data Mining. Source code is versioned in Git and
hosted on Github\footnote{Available at \url{https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-datamining}.} under
license Apache version 2.0.

The project is split into several Maven artifacts. This approach decomposes problem into smaller parts
which have dedicated functionality and can be easy reused in other projects. It also ensures that
third party dependencies are loaded only for certain artifacts where are needed. A figure \ref{appen:maven-deps}
shows dependency tree of \texttt{datamining-dist}, which is the top level artifact. The most important modules are
listed in \ref{tab:datamining-modules}. All ids of the listed artifacts have prefix \texttt{hawkular-datamining}.

    \end{center}
\end{table}

In the following sections the most important parts of the implementation are described. Described are used data
structures and algorithms.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Forecast Package}
    The forecast package is time series modelling and forecasting library. It contains several time series models
    and utility classes for time series modelling. It is designed to be easy used in any Java project. The footprint
    of the artifact is small. It depends only on Apache Math, Commons, Guava and Jboss logging.

    The core data structures from \texttt{datamining-forecast} package are interfaces of time series models
    \ref{alg:models} and forecasters. This two interfaces are related but not the same. Each time series model should
     be capable of
    predicting and learning. The main difference between forecaster and time series model is that forecaster
    is designed for online learning and it autonomously selects the most appropriate time series model. Time series
    models by default are not designed for online learning, however it can be accomplished with a wrapper class.

    Metric in the Data Mining is represented as structure \texttt{MetricContex} which contains metadata like
    collection interval, metric id and tenant id. Collection interval is necessary for calculating timestamps of
    predicted points.

    \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Interface for time series models.}, language=Java, label={alg:models}]
interface TimeSeriesModel {
    void learn(List<DataPoint> ts);
    List<DataPoint> forecast(int steps);
    int numberOfParameters();
    MetricContext context();
    AccuracyStatistics initStatistics();
    AccuracyStatistics runStatistics();
    ...
     }
    \end{lstlisting}

    List of implemented models, statistical and utility classes for time series manipulation:

    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple ex. smoothing
        \item Double ex. smoothing
        \item Triple ex. smoothing
        \item Weighted moving average
        \item Automatic forecaster
        \item Augmented Dickey\,--\,Fuller test
        \item Time series decomposition
        \item Autocorrelation function
        \item Time series lagging
        \item Time series differencing
        \item Automatic period identification
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

        %%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Automatic Forecaster}
        The most important class in Data Mining is \texttt{AutomaticForecaster}. This class autonomously
        decides which time series model should be used for modelled time series. Currently it decides from
        three implemented models: simple, double and triple exponential smoothing. Other models which implement
        interface \texttt{TimeSeriesModel} can be easy added.

        The most importantly this class is capable of dealing with concept drift. It holds circular buffer of historical
        metrics and if statistical properties of the underlying time series changes content of the buffer is used for
        selecting new model.

        The strategy when a new model should be selected is configurable. System currently
        supports two strategies. The first strategy periodically each $n$ observations selects new model.
        The Second one is more sophisticated and it selects a new model only when the error produced on learning data
        exceeds by $x\%$ error calculated on learning points when model was selected.

        Model selection is based on information criterion from section \ref{model-selection}. Automatic forecaster in
        successive steps calls optimizers of given models and then selects the best with the lowest information criterion.
        Used criterion is configurable for each forecaster.

        %%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Model Optimizers}
        Model optimizers are the most important part of the models implementation. If the model parameters are not
        estimated correctly model would produce high forecasting error. The idea behind optimization is to find such
        parameters best describes training data \cite{hyndman-state-space}. Optimization criterion can be: mean
        squared error, mean absolute error and likelihood. These criterion basically computes errors produced by ahead
        predictions. The number of prediction steps depends on the forecaster objective. The most common is to use
        only one step ahead. Data Mining currently supports only MSE criterion but others can be easy added.

        The criterion is returned from model's objective function. This objective function is passed to non-linear
        optimization algorithm from Apache Math Commons. This library implements several optimization algorithms:
        Nelder-Mead simplex, multi-directional and bound optimization by quadratic approximation (BOBYQA). These
        algorithms
        does not need computed derivatives of the cost function.

        In terms of the lowest execution time and quality of the estimated parameters the best results were produced by
        Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. The quality of estimated parameters were compared to R's estimations.

        Table \ref{tab:open-forecast-perf} contains comparison of optimizers execution times from \texttt{OpenForecast}
        and R implementation. This section adds execution time of Data Mining implementation. Complete execution times are
        listed in \ref{tab:datamining-perf}. Execution times of Data Mining's optimizers are in some cases faster than R.
        Quality of the produced forecasts is discussed in the chapter \ref{evaluation}.

        \end{table}

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{API Package}
    The next package is \texttt{api}. It depends on \texttt{forecast} and it eventually could
    depend on another library for data analysis, for instance a library for an outlier detection. In this package there
    is a code necessary for using Data Mining as a web application, for example classes for accessing data analysis
    objects for given metric.

    The interface \texttt{SubscriptionManager} was designed for accessing time series analysis objects. Some of its
    methods are listed in \ref{alg:sub-manager}. Implementation of this interface could store entities in database.
    However, Data Mining directly does not use any database. Therefore \\ \texttt{SubscriptionManager} holds all objects
    in memory. Internally it stores objects in a map where the key is tenant and value another map where the key is
    metric id and value the object for data analysis\,--\,\texttt{Subscription}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Interface \texttt{SubscriptionManager}.}, language=Java, label={alg:sub-manager}]
interface SubscriptionManager {
     void subscribe(Subscription, Owner);
     void unsubscribe(tenant, metric, Owner);
     Subscription model(tenant, metric);
     ...
     }
    \end{lstlisting}

    For subscribing it is necessary specify the owner of the prediction configuration. It was specially added for
    integration with Ineventory. It is more described in section \ref{dist}. \texttt{Subscription}. Currently  only
    time series forecasting is available. This object holds an instance of an automatic forecaster. Class diagram  of
    the most important classes from \texttt{forecast} and \texttt{api} is in \ref{appen:class-diagram}.

    Some of the service classes like \texttt{SubscriptionManager} are used in several other classes and also multiple
    implementation could exists (in memory or database implementation). Therefore dependency injection
    design pattern was introduced. Used technology is Java context dependency injection (CDI). In order to keep
    API classes clean module \texttt{cdi} with CDI configuration was introduced. It directly depends on \texttt{api},
    but does not add any other functionality.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{REST Package}
    Package \texttt{rest} contains implementation of REST services. Implementation is compatible with standard JAX-RS.

    Data Mining REST API is designed to operate on the forecasting engine. When the module is deployed into Hawkular
    main interaction with Data Mining goes through Inventory REST API and metric data are collected from JMS topic.
    However, this is not limited and Data Mining offers alternative REST endpoints which can be used in standalone
    deployment.

    REST API provide following capabilities:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Operate on subscriptions\,--\,enable and disable prediction.
        \item Push learning data to the engine.
        \item Get predictions for any number of steps ahead.
        \item Configure automatic forecaster.
        \item Get information about model being used and statistics of the predictions.
    \end{itemize}

    Accurate and more comprehensive REST API documentation is available on Hawkular web page\footnote{Available at
    \url{http://www.hawkular.org/}.}. This documentation is automatically generated using Swagger framework.

    %%%%%%%%
    \section{Distribution Package\,--\,Integration into Hawkular} \label{dist}
    As it was mentioned before the build produces two web archives, one for standalone usage and another for
    deployment into Hawkular. The second web archive adds extra functionality for interacting with other Hawkular
    components. Hawkular is packaged as a modified Wildfly server with several Hawkular components deployed.

    In Hawkular all entities are stored in Inventory, therefore Data Mining uses this module
    for querying metric definitions and it adds some extra attributes necessary for predictions. Another module
    which is used by Data Mining is Hawkular Metrics. It is a metric storage based on hybrid key-value
    database Apache Cassandra. Diagram \ref{img:hawkular-interaction} shows Data Mining integration into Hawkular.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \scalebox{0.32}{\includegraphics{img/src/architecture.pdf}}
            \caption{The integration into Hawkular.}
            \label{img:hawkular-interaction}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    When Data Mining is deployed into Hawkular users can enable predictions by creating Relationship\footnote{Entity
    from Inventory which can be created between arbitrary two entities.} from tenant to the target entity. Target
    entity can be metric, metric type or tenant. When relationship is created from tenant to tenant predictions are
    enabled for all metrics under given tenant. Similarly, when a target entity is a metric type, predictions are
    enabled for all metrics of that type. In the figure \ref{img:relationship} is depicted part of the structure of
    inventory with enabled predictions.

    Relationships also store properties needed for predictions. One of them is forecasting horizon which tells how
    many prediction steps are performed for each incoming metric data point. With this approach of storing
    relationships in Inventory, Data Mining doesn't have to use any database for entities related to predictions.
    This approach was achieved without any changes to Inventory data model, this shows that Inventory's generic data
    model build on top of graph database\footnote{Compatible with Apache Tinkerpop.} is good approach for storing data
    model in this domain.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \scalebox{0.35}{\includegraphics{img/src/inventory.pdf}}
            \caption{Relationship between entities of Inventory.}
            \label{img:relationship}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    Any changes in Inventory are propagated to Data Mining by subscribing to specific events. This propagation is done
    through JMS topic where Inventory sends these events. However on application start Data Mining also needs to query
    all predictive relationships from inventory. For this purpose JMS request-response communication was implemented in
    Inventory. Any component which has access to internal messaging subsystem can construct a query and send it for
    execution to Inventory. REST API approach was also proposed but it could expose vulnerability\,--\,client
    could access any data objects of any tenant. Diagram \ref{img:sequence-enab-pred} depicts sequence of calls
    when prediction gets enabled.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \scalebox{0.30}[0.20]{\includegraphics[angle=0]{img/src/uml-enable-predictions-sequence.pdf}}
            \caption{Sequence diagram of enabling predictions.}
            \label{img:sequence-enab-pred}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    From the diagram \ref{img:sequence-enab-pred} it is clear that when a prediction gets enabled historical metrics are
    queried from Metrics module. This means that Data Mining needs to access metrics of all tenants. It is
    similar scenario to getting all predictive relationships from Inventory. It could not be implemented via REST API
    because of potential vulnerability and JMS based query was rejected by Metrics owners.

    Another two solutions were proposed. The first was to bypass Metrics and query data directly from Cassandra.
    The second was to inject Metrics as CDI bean and directly use its Java API. The first solution was refused because
    the schema is maintained by Metrics and it can eventually change and also the backed database (Cassandra) can
    change. The final and implemented solution injectings Metrics as CDI bean. This approach assumes that Metrics
    are deployed in the same application server as Data Mining. From the performance perspective it is faster that
    JMS or REST calls.

    Diagram \ref{img:sequence-incoming-data} shows complete data flow from agent to alerts evaluation engine.
    Metric data is sent by agent to Metrics where are stored to database. Then it is sent to JMS topic
    and consumed by Alerts and Data Mining. In parallel Alerts evaluates alerts criteria and Data Mining computes
    predictions. After computation predicted data are sent to the same JMS topic and consumed by Alerts.

    Data Mining changes \texttt{id} of predicted points in order to be able to distinguish original time series from
    predicted. For predicted metrics Alerts can evaluate the same conditions as for original time series or use
    different ones. At this point an alert of predicted metrics can be triggered.

    \begin{figure}[H]

        \subsection{Hawkular UI}
        In Hawkular predictive charts are located in Metric explorer tab. In the figure \ref{img:hawkular-explorer}
        is showed predictive chart for metric accumulated garbage collection duration. In this case automatic
        forecaster decides to use seasonal model of some automatically identified period. Note that for displaying
        original time series in the chart buckets were used, so the periods would be more easily seen on raw data
        points.

        After adding concrete chart predictions can be enabled from the UI when user increases prediction horizon input.
        So there is no need to enable predictions by manually creating relationship in Inventory.

        Predictive charts were used from repository \texttt{hawkular-charts}. These charts are built on top of
        D3\footnote{Avalilable at \url{https://d3js.org/}.} library and encapsulated as Angular directives.

        \subsection{Alerts and Conditions}
        In this section is briefly described how alerting system works. Alerts is a separate module
        which is responsible for firing alerts based on defined conditions. As it is depicted in diagram
        \ref{img:sequence-incoming-data} Alerts listens on the JMS topic and if conditions for given metric are
        posityvely evaluated an alert is fired.

        Though Alerts data model is little bit more complicated. For each unique metric id can definen multiple
        conditions. These conditions are evaluated for every received metric data point on the bus. Conditions are
        grouped under a trigger. If the result of evaluation is possitive than the tigger triggers an action. This
        action can be for instance send an email, sms or perform a webhook.

        Triggers can be grouped which facilitates creation of the similar triggers. Particulary this can be used for
        creating trigger for predictive metrics. If there is a trigger defined for the original metric it can be
        duplicated and used on predicted values of that metric. If necessary the conditions can be changed in
        order to not trigger an alert if the predictions are not very accurate. For this can be used trigger dampening.
        So for the trigger which operates on predicted metrics dampening can be set as follows: \emph{``fire an alert if
        $X$ consecutive evaluations are positive``}.

    \section{Test Automation and Documentation}
    Core functionality of the application is covered by unit tests. Junit framework is used for this type of tests.
    Because Data Mining interacts with other applications and modules integration tests are also implemented. These
    tests are run from Maven profile which starts web server with necessary modules deployed.
    Last type of implemented tests are end-to-end tests which calls REST endpoint of one module and expect result
    in call from another module. This type of tests are also executed in Maven profile with running web server.
    End-to-end tests for Data Mining project live in the main Hawkular integration repository\footnote{
    Available at \url{https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular}.}.

    All tests are automatically executed every time developer creates a pull request or pushes code to the master
    branch. For this Travis continuous integration platform was used which is for free for open source projects on
    Github.

    Documentation is directly written in Java code as javadoc. REST API documentation is also directly
    written in source code using Swagger framework and automatically generated at build time
    \footnote{Available at \url{http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-datamining.html}.}.

    \section{Releases}
    By the time writing of this thesis there was only one release with version \texttt{0.1.Final}. It is also available
    in the Maven central repository. Complete group id is \texttt{org.hawkular.datamining}. The most important
    artifact ids are listed in \ref{tab:datamining-modules}. Release notes are available on
    Github\footnote{Available at \url{https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-datamining/releases}.}.

    \section{Retrospective}
    In this section is mentioned how the project was changing, what did not worked well and what could have be done
    better.

    At the beginning of the project Apache Spark\footnote{Open source cluster computing framework available at
    \url{https://spark.apache.org/}.} was used for building regression models. It's machine learning library (MLIB)
    offers several learning algorithms. In Data Mining linear regression with stochastic gradient descent was used.
    Because the gradient is stochastic produced predictions are not very robust and quickly change by significant value.

    Spark was mainly used because of its streaming extension that can handle
    high-throughput stream data \cite{apache-spark}. There is also time series library
    \texttt{spark-ts}\footnote{Available at \url{https://github.com/sryza/spark-timeseries}.} which contains some
    time series models but does not offer functionality of automatic model selection.

    Due to problems discussed in \ref{sec:linear-regression} and lack of automatic forecaster decision was made
    to drop Spark and directly implement exponential smoothing models.

    During the implementation a lot of time was spent on integration with other modules, in particular with Inventory.
    The problem was that Inventory is developed by another party and any concrete document
    describing the integration was not proposed. The design of the integration was understood differently
    by both parties, what lead to reimplementing of some parts. Therefore it is better to precisely define the
    integration interface with other modules or projects.
